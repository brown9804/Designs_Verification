# Making verilog makefile
# Makefile to simulate Verilog HDL designs under OSX.

###### IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!
###### NEED TO BE READED
# Please note that the gtkwave command referes to a specific
# path so removed or just do in the command line console:
# <folder path>$ gtkwave <vcd file with the vcd extention>

# 							Makefile logic:
# To create this file you need these files:
# $ @ replace left
# $ ^ right

#******************************************************************************
#										TARGETS
#******************************************************************************
### 						YOSYS
# To generate the structural design of the
# behavioral design automatically through synthesis
#It is defined as a roughly RTL (Register Transfer Level)
#synthesizer that allows you to convert the HDL (Hardware
# Description Language) code into an electronic scheme.
# Coming to show the components connected to each other what
# is usually called RTL network list which is associated with
# the level of registry transfer. Considering that what it allows
# is to model a synchronous digital circuit in terms of digital signal
# flow (this being data) relating it to the hardware registers and the
# logical operations that are carried out in each signal.


### 						SED
# Replaces on the synthesized file the name module,
# because for making the stuctural decription we use the
# behavioral on yosys

#### 					 IVERILOG
# It is defined as an HDL (Hardware Description Language),
#  this being a modeled hardware language, that is, it allows
#  describing a simulation of digital circuits. It can be seen
# as the tool that allows to provide the specifications to carry
# out a physical component which is being modeled.
# 	Example of command:
# iverilog -o ./vvp/TestBench_21_2.vvp ./TestBenchAUTONST/TestBench_21_2.v
# Its automatic, because each time you are asked for a vvp
# you need one with con.v

### 					GTKWAVE
# We can define it as a visualization of simulation results
# where one of its advantages is that by means of a visualization
# of signal waves we can understand the problem when it
# is found by using the testbench.
